#  Search the vectors for an image
## 1 = background, 0 = image. 
### Imagine we have an image. We'll represent this image as a simple 2D array where every pixel is a 1 or a 0. 
### The image you get is known to have a single rectangle of 0s on a background of 1s.
**ASSIGNMENT**
- Write a function that takes in the image and returns the coordinates of the rectange of 0's.
- Either top left and bottom right, or top left width and height

__ADDITIONAL DETAILS__
x:3, y:2 Width: 3, height: 2
2, 3 3,5 -- row, column of the top-left and bottom-right corners
3m2m5m3 -- x,y of the top-left and bottom-right corners (as long as //you stay consistent, either format is fine.)
