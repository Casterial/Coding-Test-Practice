# Coding Test Practice
### This repo contains test practice for various coding challenges from companies. These are not direct test, but coding challenges to warm up for company test.

**C++ / Python**
Every file will be worked on in either C++ or Python, depending on what I am working on during the day.
- Each folder will contain a README.md which will hold the challenge information, as well as a .py or .cpp file which holds the answer. 


                                       I'm available at Logan_shelton@hotmail.com
